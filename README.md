# ASIS - Advanced Simple Installer Script

## What the hell is that?
This is ASIS. An installer script for Inno Setup. The creator of this script, KaktoR said he will probably not support it anymore in the future, so I decided to preserve and archive a decent working version of it here. This is version 7.2.0 Update 5 of ASIS. Improvements are welcome here.
